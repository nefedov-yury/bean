This is rewrote version of AbsCor from Boss:
  Analysis/PhotonCor/AbsCor

Supported Versions:

6.6.1 == AbsCor-00-00-26
6.6.2 == 6.6.3 == 6.6.4 == 6.6.5 == AbsCor-00-00-28


7.0.2 == 7.0.3 == 7.0.4 == 7.0.5 == 7.0.6 == 7.0.7 == AbsCor-00-00-36
Notes:
The Bean does not have 'edgecor' correction, because they use
functions from the detector description package (see EmcRecGeoSvc).


7.0.8 ==  AbsCor-00-00-40 almost the same as
7.0.9 ==  AbsCor-00-00-41
Notes:
AbsCor in Bean does not use the database, but you can read files with
calibrations in functions:
      void ReadDatac3p(std::string DataPathc3p, bool info=true);
      void ReadParMcCor(std::string paraPath, bool info=true);
      void ReadCorFunpara(std::string CorFunparaPath, bool info=true);
An example of using these functions is contained in the file:
BeanUser/TestAbsCor.cxx

The path to the calibration files (on /cvmfs) can be obtained using
the python3 program 'GetAbsCorFiles.py', see folder bean/scripts/.

7.1.0 == AbsCor-00-01-45 minor changes: the names of three variables
                         have been changed
7.1.1 == AbsCor-00-01-46 == AbsCor-00-01-45
