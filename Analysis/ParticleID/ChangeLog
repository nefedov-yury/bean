	* chi value of low momentum for proton/Kaon/Pion from round05/09/11/12 Jpsi data in DedxPID is corrected.
	* the reconstructed momenta after kalman correction are used in DedxPID.
2020-03-22 sunss@ihep.ac.cn
	* A bug is fixed in ParticleID.cxx, changed a loop from 4 to 5
	* Remove low momentum proton correction based on 09 Jpsi data in previous version
2019-10-21 lujd@ihep.ac.cn
	* normPH and GoodHits cut in Dedx is canceled.
	* chi value of low momentum in Dedx is corrected.
	* some proton offset was set to -999 in txt file, which cause very big chi in PID, it is
	set to 0 now.
2019-08-06 sunss@ihep.ac.cn
        * A warning sentence is commented since it is not suitable for MRPC
	end cap TOF anymore.
2018-11-14 sunss@ihep.ac.cn
	* based on the validation of jpsi->ppbarpipi, the sigma of proton *1.5
2018-11-09 sunss@ihep.ac.cn
	* re-set of m_sigma[i], fix sigma value of mrpc end cap TOF
2018-09-01 sunss@ihep.ac.cn
	* a memeory leackage is correct in TofCorr
2018-08-06 sunss@ihep.ac.cn
	* In TofCorr, there are no enough stastic in some momentum range for proton and anti-proton, so the sigma is set as -999 in txt file, and convert to 0.001 in procedure. This would cause a very small chi in PID, it is set as 0.3 ns now.
2016-11-02 sunss@ihep.ac.cn
	* The sigma of MRPC endcap TOF is modified, it is divided into strip and momentum. It is based on the pion sample of kkpipi/4pi/gam4pi/5pi etc decay channels of 2015-16 data at 4.18GeV
2015-10-29 sunss@ihep.ac.cn
	* ParticleID-00-04-61
	The TofEPID is updated for both Scintillator and MRPC, which is based on v00-04-59
	The secondary correction is also applied for all data using jpsi2012's parameters, as previous update. The MRPC is also supported.
2015-07-14 sunss@ihep.ac.cn
        * The TOF secondary correction will be applied for all data using jpsi2012's parameters. based on ParticleID-00-04-58
2015-04-15 sunss@ihep.ac.cn
	* The correction for jpsi2009 is removed. That means all the data and MC will be corrected using jpsi2012's result.
2014-12-04 sunss@ihep.ac.cn
	* A bug in TofCorrPid for endcap TOF is fixed
	* Particle class support setChiMax, which default is 6.
	* in Particle class init, chimincut and chimaxcut are 4 and 6.
	* endcap secondary correction is updated using west endcap
2014-10-28 sunss@ihep.ac.cn
	* TOF secondary correction parameters for 2012 Jpsi MC is added
	* several functions, such as dt, dtcorr, sigcorr and chicorr are added.
	* Since the corresponding codes are not published, MRPC related update is not include.
2014-04-08 Matthias.Ullrich@physik.uni-giessen.de
	MRPC upgrade is added and can now be used for PID calculation
2013-03-04 sunss@ihep.ac.cn
	the parameters of sigma of anti-proton for endcap tof is added.
2013-03-01 sunss@ihep.ac.cn

2013-02-01 sunss@ihep.ac.cn
	the correction for low momentum proton and anti-proton is added into the package.
2013-01-30 sunss@ihep.ac.cn
	this is a test version for physics experters.
	the TOF correction for hadrons for jpsi data taken in 2009 is include in this version.
