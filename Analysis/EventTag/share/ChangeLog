1)create new decay.codes file, based on current decay table for EvtGen, and optimized for 
	ignorePhoton=true option;
2)Topology information is now filled off-resonance events
3)tau decay codes now filled for tau-tau events
4)GeneralEventType now calculated automaticaly, if initial value is 0;
5)new manual added

version 1.05
1) modified to recognize FSR photons (with pdg=-22). new option 
  "ignoreFSR" is added. defoult value is true.
  If  ignoreFSR=true while ignorePhoton=false, radiative
  decays(specified in decay table for EvtGen) is correctly recognized,
  while FSR photons is ignored.
   new decay code table is added for this option: decayFSR.codes  
Default behavie is still ignorePhoton=true, like 1.04
