This is the EventTag package adapted for the bean,
augmented with a class DecayTable to store the decay table as a text.

 File 'pdt_bean.table' is taken from the BesEvtGen package:
 boss-7.1.2/Generator/BesEvtGen/BesEvtGen-00-04-30/share/pdt.table


 DecayTable contains:
 *) variables:
    decays: table string with final particles -> number of decays
            this is "global" table one per job
    vecdes: vector with decay products (pdg-codes) of studied
            particle; this variable may change for each event
    ntot:   total number of decays
 *) functions:
    Size():   size of table
    Reset():  clear vecdec
    StrDec(): convert vecdec to string with pdg names
    Add():    fill in the table according to the decay stored
              in the vecdec
    Print(min_percent):
              print table sorted by percentage of each decay
              up to min_percent
